# LSTM/GRU for Time Series Classification





##  2017-06-04
* The code is compatible for python 3.6 and tensorflow 1.1.
* The static RNN is deployed in the post [LSTM_tsc](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/LSTM_tsc) and we adopt the dynamical RNN in
  tensorflow to achieve better computational speed.
* We further modify the batch process and add the GRU cells.
* For the ChlorineConcentration data set, applying the train-test (10%/90%) split discussed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06995v4.pdf), it is easy to reach >75% test accuracy.
